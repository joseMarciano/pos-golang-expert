In Go (Golang), `NewServeMux` refers to the function in the `net/http` package used to create a new instance of a request multiplexer, commonly known as a ServeMux.

A `ServeMux` is an HTTP request router or multiplexer that matches the incoming requests against a list of registered patterns and calls the handler for the pattern that most closely matches the request URL. It is often used to set up different routes for handling different HTTP requests within a web application.

### NewServeMux Function

The `NewServeMux` function creates and returns a new ServeMux. It is typically used when you want to create a custom HTTP server and define how different URLs should be handled.

**Example:**

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
```


### ServeMux
The `ServeMux` itself is an HTTP request router that matches the URL patterns of incoming requests and directs them to the corresponding registered handler functions.

Example:

```go
mux.HandleFunc("/hello", helloHandler)
mux.HandleFunc("/goodbye", goodbyeHandler)
```
